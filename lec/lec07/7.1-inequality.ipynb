    "## The Lorenz Curve\n",
    "The Lorenz Curve visually presents income inequality by plotting household income percentile on the $x$-axis, and the cumulative income share that the bottom $x$ percentile own on the $y$-axis. The households are sorted by income, so that the first household at the 0th percentile has the least amount of income, while the household at the 100th percentile has the greatest income.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any point $(x,y)$ on the Lorenz curve, “the bottom x percent own y% of the income”. For example, if the $x$-axis reads 0.30 and $y$-axis reads 0.10, then it means that the bottom 30% of the population received 10% of the total population's income. This yields 2 implications for the Lorenz Curve:\n",
    "- The points $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ are always on the curve. $(0,0)$ represents the 0% of the population owning 0% of the income and $(1,1)$ represents 100% of the population owning 100% of the income.\n",
    "- The slope is always increasing. This is because households are sorted by income as percentiles: for a slight increase in $x$, households become richer and hence provide a larger share of total income.\n"

    "In a world of perfect equality, everyone would have the exact same income. In this case, the Lorenz curve would just be a 45-degree straight line that runs through $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$, i.e. $y=x$. Mathematically, this is because the derivative is constant: for a slight increase in $x$, the total share of income increases at a constant rate. Another way to think about this is that the bottom 10% of the population will own 10% of the total income, the bottom 50% of the population will own 50% of the total income, and so on. This line is known as the *line of perfect equality*, and we typically display this line when plotting our Lorenz curves as a reference."
